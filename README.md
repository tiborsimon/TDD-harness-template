TDD-harness-template
====================

Test harness template to use __TDD__ in __embedded systems__ in C.

The __current v1.0__ version uses __Unity__ (http://throwtheswitch.org/) to run the tests, but in the future I plan to use __Cpputest__ (http://cpputest.github.io/) as the main test framework.

---

The __master__ branch will always point to the latest version of the test harness.

The other branches will point to my learning examples, partially based on the book _Test Driven Development for Embedded C_ (https://pragprog.com/book/jgade/test-driven-development-for-embedded-c), and partially my _Simple Input_ project.

---

You need _Cygwin_ to compile the sources. I have installed the _Dev_ package to run this, but basically you only need gcc and make to be able to compile. 

The project also contains a __Sublime project file__. Open Sublime, open the project in it, hit __F7__, and it will build the harness for you! Easy as pie! :)
